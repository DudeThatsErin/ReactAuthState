# **React Authentication State Demo**

## **Introduction**

This project is a simple **authentication system** built using **React** and **SQLite**, designed to handle user registration, login, and profile management. The app stores user credentials securely and handles session management for authenticated users. It is built to work on both **web and mobile platforms** using **React Native Web**.

The authentication system ensures user data is securely stored and verified through a MySQL database, and the session is maintained via authentication tokens.

## **Technologies Used**

We’ve utilized the following technologies for this project:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows us to create a dynamic and responsive app with reusable components.
- **React Native Web**: This enables us to use React Native components in the browser, making our app compatible with both mobile and web devices.
- **SQLite**: A serverless, self-contained SQL database engine used to manage user authentication data locally on the device.
- **MySQL**: A relational database management system used to store user registration data (username, password, etc.) securely on the server side.
- **PHP**: Used for server-side scripts to handle API requests like user registration, login, profile updates, and session management.
- **CORS**: Handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow communication between the frontend (React) and the backend (PHP).
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for managing authentication tokens to ensure secure communication between the frontend and the backend.
- **HTML & CSS**: For structuring and styling the app's user interface.
- **Babel**: A JavaScript compiler that helps ensure compatibility across browsers by transpiling modern JavaScript syntax.
- **Fetch API**: Used for making HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend for user authentication and data handling.

## **What This App Does**

- **User Registration**: Allows users to create a new account by providing a username, email, and password. The password is securely hashed and stored in the MySQL database.
- **User Login**: Authenticated users can log in by providing their credentials. Upon successful login, a session is created using a JWT token, ensuring the user stays logged in.
- **Profile Management**: Users can update their account details, such as username and password, with proper validation and secure data handling.
- **Session Management**: The app uses JWT for maintaining sessions and ensures that users are redirected if their session has expired.
- **Mobile & Web Compatibility**: The app works seamlessly across both mobile and desktop browsers, leveraging React Native Web for cross-platform compatibility.

This project is a simple counter app developed using React and React Native Web, which allows users to increment the counter by predefined values or reset it. It is designed to work on both mobile and web platforms. The app uses AsyncStorage to persist the counter value even after the page is reloaded.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Native Web**: Allows React Native components to be rendered in the browser, making the app compatible with both mobile and web.
- **AsyncStorage**: Used for storing the counter value persistently in the browser’s local storage.
- **Babel**: A JavaScript compiler used to transpile modern JavaScript syntax for compatibility across browsers.
- **HTML, CSS**: For structuring and styling the app.

## What This App Does

- **Counter Functionality**: Users can click buttons to increment the counter by various values (1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 50, or 100).
- **Persistent Storage**: The counter value is saved to the local storage (using AsyncStorage), so the count is preserved even after refreshing or closing the app.
- **Reset Button**: Users can reset the counter to 0, and the counter value will be removed from local storage.
- **Mobile & Web Compatibility**: The app works on both mobile devices and desktop browsers by utilizing React Native Web.
