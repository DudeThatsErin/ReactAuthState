This project is a simple counter app developed using React and React Native Web, which allows users to increment the counter by predefined values or reset it. It is designed to work on both mobile and web platforms. The app uses AsyncStorage to persist the counter value even after the page is reloaded.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Native Web**: Allows React Native components to be rendered in the browser, making the app compatible with both mobile and web.
- **AsyncStorage**: Used for storing the counter value persistently in the browserâ€™s local storage.
- **Babel**: A JavaScript compiler used to transpile modern JavaScript syntax for compatibility across browsers.
- **HTML, CSS**: For structuring and styling the app.

## What This App Does

- **Counter Functionality**: Users can click buttons to increment the counter by various values (1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 50, or 100).
- **Persistent Storage**: The counter value is saved to the local storage (using AsyncStorage), so the count is preserved even after refreshing or closing the app.
- **Reset Button**: Users can reset the counter to 0, and the counter value will be removed from local storage.
- **Mobile & Web Compatibility**: The app works on both mobile devices and desktop browsers by utilizing React Native Web.
